Qus 1 : Read about the difference between  window ,screen and document in js
  Ans : 
        Window: The window object represents an instance of a web browser window.
                The window object provides a global scope for JavaScript code running in a web page.
                It represents the current window or tab that the user is interacting with and provides methods and properties to control and interact with it.

        Some common operations performed using the window object include:

        * Controlling the browser window size and position.
        * Navigating to different URLs.
        * Opening new browser windows or tabs.
        * Displaying alert dialogs.
        * Setting and retrieving cookies.

        Screen: The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
                It provides information about the user's display capabilities and properties.
                The screen object is a property of the window object, so you can access it using window.screen.

        Some useful properties of the screen object include:
       * screen.width and screen.height provide the screen's dimensions in pixels.
       * screen.availWidth and screen.availHeight provide the available screen dimensions (excluding operating system elements like the taskbar).
       * screen.pixelDepth provides the color depth of the screen in bits per pixel.

        Document: The document object represents the HTML document loaded in a web page. 
                  It provides access to the content and structure of the web page, allowing JavaScript code to manipulate and interact with the page's elements.
                  The document object is a property of the window object, so you can access it using window.document or simply document.

      Some common operations performed using the document object include:

       * Accessing and manipulating HTML elements and their attributes.
       * Modifying the content of the web page.
       * Adding or removing HTML elements dynamically.
       * Registering event handlers to respond to user actions.
       * Querying and modifying CSS styles.
       * Managing form data and handling user input.
      The document object is at the core of client-side JavaScript programming, as it enables dynamic and interactive web page behavior.

In summary, the window object represents the browser window or tab, 
            the screen object represents the user's screen, and 
            the document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window. 
            They serve different purposes and provide different functionalities in JavaScript programming.
